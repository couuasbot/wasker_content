# Zero to One: A Practical Guide to OpenClaw Skill Development

In the OpenClaw architecture, a **Skill** is a "plugin" that grants the AI specialized capabilities. This post documents the development of `blog-archiver`, an automated skill designed to streamline content production.

## 1. Background

To improve efficiency, we needed a skill that could automatically summarize and translate conversation logs, archive them into the `wasker_vue` blog system, and handle local build validation and PR submission.

## 2. Planning and Design

A standard Skill typically consists of:
- **SKILL.md**: Core instruction set defining triggers and workflows.
- **scripts/**: Scripts for deterministic logic (optional).
- **references/**: Schemas or patterns for model reference (optional).

For `blog-archiver`, the focus is on **multi-step workflow orchestration**.

## 3. Development Steps

### A. Initialization
Creating the standard directory structure using `init_skill.py` or manual setup.
```bash
skills/blog-archiver/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/
└── references/
```

### B. Defining Core Instructions (SKILL.md)
Establishing strict engineering standards in `SKILL.md`, such as Frontmatter formats, directory allocation (`zh/` vs `en/`), and the requirement that the `category` field must remain in English.

### C. Engineering Validation
A Skill is more than just a document; it's about **environmental closure**. The instructions require the model to run `npm run build` or `pnpm build` within the target project to ensure that the newly generated Markdown does not break the existing static site build.

## 4. Conclusion

The essence of a Skill is transforming "human engineering experience" into "AI operational specifications." Using the `skill-creator` framework, we can rapidly replicate complex automated workflows as seen in [[Wasker Series: Markdown-Driven Frontend Architecture]], evolving the AI from a simple chat tool into a true engineering assistant (see [[Soul on Disk: Deep Dive into OpenClaw's Context Memory and Working Principles]] for technical details).
