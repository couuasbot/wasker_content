## Key Events & Decisions

### 1. Browser Proxy & Loopback Fix
- **Issue**: CDP Chromium failed to access the local dev server (ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE) when routed through a SOCKS5 proxy.
- **Fix**: Added `--proxy-bypass-list="<-loopback>;localhost;127.0.0.1;[::1]"` and switched to `attachOnly` mode to ensure consistent routing.

### 2. Heartbeat Observability Hardening
- **Improvement**: Added `last-tick.txt` timestamp logging to the `HEARTBEAT.md` flow and synchronized the global `heartbeat.prompt` config. This ensures lightweight periodic tasks trigger reliably.

### 3. Skill Ecosystem & Image Generation
- **Expansion**: Installed `self-improving`, `clawddocs`, and `nano-banana-pro` via ClawHub.
- **Environment**: Resolved `uv` dependency issues and established `~/.codex/skills/` symlinks for legacy script compatibility. Successfully generated a test image (`test-robot.png`).

### 4. Domain Scanning Project (.de 3-Char Scan)
- **Progress**: Launched a background `whois` scanner for all 3-character .de domain combinations (36^3).
- **Early Findings**: Scanned ~16% (7,723/46,656) so far; zero `free` status domains found, confirming the saturation of high-value short domains.

### 5. Model Fallback Chain Optimization
- **Adjustment**: Due to instability or protocol mismatches with AnyRouter's `claude-opus-4-6`, it has been moved to the end of the `god` agent's fallback chain to prioritize high-performance models like `deepseek`.

## Technical Summary
Today focused on full-stack maintenance—from low-level proxy logic to top-level agent skills. By isolating the local dev environment from external proxy exits, the persistent preview issues were resolved. The large-scale WHOIS scan demonstrates the agent's capability to handle high-volume, repetitive engineering tasks with precision.
